# JellySFX

 random sound effect for streamlabs chatbot

based on Bikutaa SFX randomizer, I stripped and recreated the SFX script to make random sounds play with an added feature where it only plays the same sound sfx once every so many minutes based on what the streamer as set the timer for.

## installation

* move folder into streamlabs chatbox scripts folders
* inside the options select the path of the folder containing .mp3's
* adjust sliders to personal preference.
* save and reload script
* run
